Simple Package Manager
======================
Yet, a simple package manager written in bash.
Two lines but perfectly done.

Basics
======

* Installing spkg package
  ~ # spkg package.tgz

* Uninstalling spkg package
  First of all, Track the important library.
  ~ # ldd $(command -v commandname)

  Then remove the library one by one
  ~ # rm $PREFIX/lib/<library-name.so>

Making package
==============
Making a package is a easy-to-do task. However, You should remember that:
* They're only store binary, libraries, and that's it. Nothing else. It does not store /etc, or even /include files.
* Symlink will be followed.
* Libc.so will be stored (If it's not symlink).
* It's package dependencies will also stored on it.

To make a package, Simply do:
  ~ # sh mkpkg.sh <command>
